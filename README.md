PROJECT NAME: ARL Battlespace

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A Python strategy game, similar to Axis and Allies, Battleship, and chess. It is a simple wargame with two teams of two players each, i.e. two humans versus two AIs. The purpose is to provide a flexible platform to develop novel AIs for command and control decision aids. The AIs in this game take random actions, either from a uniform distribution or from a human-derived distribution. The focus of this project is to modify the AIs based on reinforcement learning, and in particular to tackle multiplayer decision-making.

This repo contains the source code to the wargame ARL Battlespace. The configuration is 1 server + 2 clients, i.e. one standalone machine or multiple machines across a network, on Windows, Mac, Linux platforms.

# Setting up
1) Install Python (e.g. 3.7.9) and Anaconda (e.g. 4.9.2)
2) conda install dill numpy Pillow

# Running Two Humans vs. UniformRandomAgent AI, Capture-the-Flag game with Wall (minefield)
The two humans begin in the North quadrants, and the 2 AI players begin in the South quadrants. Each player has 3 ground units, 1 air unit, and a flag. The opposing forces are separated by a minefield with a gap. The humans should cooperate to breach the gap and destory the enemy forces or capture the flags. Units have limited visibility.


1) Open 2 terminal windows. One will be the Server, and the other will be Client 1 (i.e. Player 1, a.k.a. 'Agent 2'). Open a 3rd terminal window either on this machine or on another machine.

2) In terminal 1 ('Server'), navigate to the 'test' folder.

3) Start the server by typing: python ServerWithUI.py --test<BR>
	Note your Server's external IP address (e.g. 71.114.23.43) and your server's local IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.13)

4) If one or both clients are communicating with the server across a network, modify your server's router's Port Forwarding so that port 5050 is forwarded to your server's local IP address.

5) In terminal 2 ('Client 1'), navigate to the 'test' folder.  Type:  python HumanInterface.py<BR>
If terminal 2 is on the same machine as terminal 1:<BR>
--   If the Router is set up for Port Forwarding: Hit [Enter].  It will automatically reach out to your server on the same machine.<BR>
--   If the Router is not set up for Port Forwarding, type in your local IP address, then hit [Enter].

6) In terminal 3 ('Client 2', a.k.a. 'Agent 3'), navigate to the 'test' folder. Type:  python HumanInterface.py<BR>
-- If terminal 3 is on a computer across the network: Type the address of the server, i.e. 71.114.23.43.<BR>
-- If terminal 3 is on the same computer as the server: Hit [Enter] (if Port Forwarding) or type in your local IP address and hit <enter> (not Port Forwarding).

7) Player 1 (i.e. 'Agent 2') begins clicking on the yellow region to place units (3 ground, 1 air, 1 flag). Alert Player 2 to begin placing units.

8) Player 2 (i.e. 'Agent 3') waits for Player 1 to finish placing units. Player 2 then begins clicking on the yellow region to place units.

9) Player 1 enters actions into the terminal.  Ground and air units can advance, turn, and fire missiles. Ground units can also ram (advance 1 step and attack). Ground units can capture the flag, but they cannot run into walls (mine fields). Air units can bomb the square directly below and fly over walls (mine fields), but cannot capture the flag.

10) Player 2 enters actions into the terminal

11) AIs plan their actions. All Player and AI actions are executed simultaneously and first round ends. Play continues. Game ends when both enemy flags are captured, or all enemy ground units are destroyed.
